      <h1>Joseph James Smith</h1>
      <h2>Electronic and Computer Engineering Graduate</h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent BEng Electronic and Computer Engineering graduate from the University of York 
        having studied in areas including cloud and distributed computing, algorithms, FPGA development, 
        and control systems. During my degree, I completed a year-long industry placement with an 
        electronics and software consultancy. There I worked on embedded systems, FPGA projects, and 
        developed CI/CD pipelines. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, 
        and I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and collaborative experience to a dynamic 
        engineering team.
